# Matt's DOM Utils (@LIBRARY_NAME@)

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* is a toolbox for the HTML DOM. By minimally wrapping the DOM,
it enables developers to learn about the API without the fog of heavy
abstractions.

## License

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* is licensed under the MIT License. In concordance with the
MIT License, use the provided source code under any scenario.

---

## Optional Modules

### Raise

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides error messages based upon the DOM 4 spec. Each
documented error type has a method provided to "raise" (throw) the
corresponding error.

### Types

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides an object containing every specified `nodeType` based
upon the DOM 4 spec.

### Is

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides identification tests. These include tests for
document tree node-like objects as well as "host objects". Utilising
these tests allows scripts to degrade gracefully.

### Node

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a set of wrappers for various methods of
of the `Node` interface. In particular, this includes
`Node::appendChild` and `Node::removeChild`.

See ./Tests/Node for examples.

### Create

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a set of wrappers for various methods of
creation. In particular, this includes `Node::createElement` and
`Node::createTextNode`.

See ./Tests/Create for examples.

### Classes

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a DOM Level 4 spec-style `Element::classList`
implementation. This includes methods for testing, adding,
removing and retrieving class tokens.

See ./Tests/Classes for examples.

### Traverse

*@LIBRARY_NAME@*'s main focus is diverse DOM traversal. This includes
utilities for `Node::childNodes`, `Node::children` and text along
with more general methods of traversal.

See ./Tests/Traverse for examples.

### Text

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a DOM Level 4 spec-style `Node::textContent`
implementation. This includes methods for getting and setting text.

See ./Tests/Text for examples.

### Ancestors

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides various methods for traversal of document
tree ancestors.

See ./Tests/Ancestors for examples.

### Select

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a set of wrappers for various methods of
selection. This includes popular methods such as
`Document::getElementById`, `getElementsByTagName` and newer
methods such as `NodeSelector::querySelectorAll`.

See ./Tests/Select for examples.

### Event

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a set of methods to add event listeners
for both the DOM Level 2+ and MSHTML event models alongside methods
to bind and unbind event handlers.

See ./Tests/Event for examples.

---

## Builds

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a configure.ac file, which resonates
thoughout the entire project tree.

### Configuration

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides a configure.ac file, which can be
edited to amend the project tree. In order to compile it,
GNU Autotools (specifically `autoconf`) must be available to
the system.

#### Project Name

A Bash variable is utilised in order to build the entire project
tree under a variable name. This can then be edited in the configure.ac
file, and then compiled into the configure script.

To use a custom project name, find the following snippet in configure.ac:

        # your library name here

        AC_SUBST(LIBRARY_NAME)
        LIBRARY_NAME="Utils";

and amend the `LIBRARY_NAME` variable's value to another string value.

Then, call the following command:

        autoconf

in the project root to create a configure script from the file.

Finally, run the configure script by calling:

        ./configure

in the project root. This will echo the changes to the configure.ac file
throughout the project tree.

### Makefile

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides some simple options for build creation via
./Makefile.

#### Head

`make head` (exports to ./Builds/Uncompressed/utils-head.js).
This contains the license and global variables.

#### Complete

`make complete` (exports to ./Builds/Uncompressed/utils-complete.js).

#### Minified

`make compress` (runs all hard-coded builds through the YUI Compressor
to ./Builds/Compressed).

#### All

`make` or `make all` will run all of the above options.

### Custom Builds

*@LIBRARY_NAME@* provides multiple options for custom builds.

#### Command-Line

`./build.sh [modules]` will pass the specified modules to the
build script and will then export the result to
./Builds/Uncompressed/utils-build.js.

##### Example

`./build.sh traverse text`

#### Server-Side

A server-side builder is located at the project site, which
provides an easy way to string together files for those
who cannot or do not wish to run command-line code.
