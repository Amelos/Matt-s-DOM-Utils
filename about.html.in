					<em>Utils</em> was created for a multitude of reasons.
					The first of which was a disgust for the current state
					of "popular" HTML DOM scripting (i.e. DOM "selectors");
					the second of which was to allow developers everywhere
					that choose not to support "inadequate" browsers,
					sometimes out of spite, to support as many browsers as
					possible; the third of which was to dispel fear and
					uncertainty of the DOM API by providing a clean, concise
					API as an intermediary; the final of which was a long period
					of unemployment with a glaring need for a showcase project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, <em>Utils</em> was created to transform
					HTML DOM scripting. By eschewing DOM "selectors" for
					highly customizable callbacks, developers regain control
					of traversal and are freed from the behest of 
					<code>RegExp</code> string parsers and CSS engines. This
					strategy allows for very powerful traversal, which is
					easy to understand and far more "native" to developers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Moreover, <em>Utils</em> treats non-element nodes with
					care and respect. Traversal methods are provided for
					unfiltered trees, allowing for a full, representative
					view of the document tree.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary tenet of <em>Utils</em> is graceful degradation.
					Whereas graceful degradation is easily achieved with HTML and CSS,
					graceful degradation with HTML DOM scriping is far more difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Utils</em> is written in a very defensive style borne of
					research both from tests and documentation. Every environment
					is treated with an objective eye; there is no code written to
					specifically pander to or castigate an environment.
