					<em>@LIBRARY_NAME@</em> was created for a multitude of reasons.
					The first of which was a disgust for the current state
					of &ldquo;popular&rdquo; HTML DOM scripting
					(i.e. DOM &ldquo;selectors&rdquo;); the second of which was to
					allow developers everywhere that choose not to support
					&ldquo;inadequate&rdquo; browsers, sometimes out of spite, to
					support as many browsers as possible; the third of which was to
					dispel fear and uncertainty of the DOM API by providing a clean,
					concise API as an intermediary; the final of which was a long period
					of unemployment with a glaring need for a showcase project.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, <em>@LIBRARY_NAME@</em> was created to transform
					HTML DOM scripting. By eschewing DOM &ldquo;selectors&rdquo; for
					wrapped DOM selection methods and highly customizable callbacks,
					developers regain control of traversal and are freed from the
					behest of <code>RegExp</code> string parsers and CSS engines.
					This strategy allows for very powerful traversal, which is
					subjectively easy to understand and far more "native" to
					developers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Moreover, <em>@LIBRARY_NAME@</em> treats non-element nodes with
					care and respect. Traversal methods are provided for
					unfiltered trees, allowing for a full, representative
					view of the document tree.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary tenet of <em>@LIBRARY_NAME@</em> is &ldquo;Graceful Degradation&rdquo;.
					Whereas &ldquo;Graceful Degradation&rdquo; is easily achieved with HTML and CSS,
					&ldquo;Graceful Degradation&rdquo; with HTML DOM scriping is far more difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>@LIBRARY_NAME@</em> is written in a very defensive style borne of
					research both from tests and documentation. Every environment
					is treated with an objective eye; there is no code written to
					specifically pander to or castigate an environment.
